In this section, $\FuncWritesDynamicArray$ and $\FuncWritesGrowthArray$ will denote the write cost functions for dynamic and growth arrays, respectively. My goal is to approximate the ratio $\dfrac{\FuncTimeDynamicArray(n)}{\FuncTimeGrowthArray(n)}$ for large $n$. From my assumption near the beginning of Section \ref{subsec:Appending}, this is equal to $\dfrac{\FuncWritesDynamicArray(n)}{\FuncWritesGrowthArray(n)}$. I derived earlier that
\begin{align*}
\left( \frac{\VarGrowthFactor}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \right) n \FluteLeq \FuncWritesDynamicArray(n) &\FluteLess \left( \frac{2\VarGrowthFactor - 1}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \right) n
\end{align*}
From Theorem \ref{thm:BothSidesInequality}, I may divide all sides of this inequality by $n$ to receive
\begin{align*}
\frac{\VarGrowthFactor}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \FluteLeq \frac {\FuncWritesDynamicArray(n)} n &\FluteLess \frac{2\VarGrowthFactor - 1}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1}
\end{align*}
It was shown earlier that $\FuncWritesGrowthArray(n) \sim n$. From Theorem \ref{thm:MergesOverOps}, $\dfrac {\FuncWritesDynamicArray(n)} n \sim \dfrac{\FuncWritesDynamicArray(n)}{\FuncWritesGrowthArray(n)}$. From Theorem \ref{thm:InterchangeableInInequality}, it follows that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\VarGrowthFactor}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \FluteLeq \frac {\FuncWritesDynamicArray(n)} {\FuncWritesGrowthArray(n)} &\FluteLess \frac{2\VarGrowthFactor - 1}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1}
\end{align*}
For $\VarGrowthFactor = 2$, this can be interpreted as ``For large $n$, dynamic arrays make approximately $2$ to $3$ times as many writes as growth arrays. \underline{Thus, for large $n$, they are about $2$ to $3$ times slower than growth arrays.}''

Let $\FuncSpaceDynamicArray(n)$ and $\FuncSpaceGrowthArray(n)$ be the space cost functions for dynamic and growth arrays, respectively. I wish to approximate the ratio $\dfrac{\FuncSpaceDynamicArray(n)}{\FuncSpaceGrowthArray(n)}$ for large $n$. Recall that
\begin{align*}
\FuncSpaceDynamicArray(n) = \left( \frac{\VarGrowthFactor^{\VarUseful + 1} - 1}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \right) \VarInitCapacity
\end{align*}
and that $\FuncSpaceGrowthArray(n) \sim \VarCapacitySeq_\VarUseful = \VarGrowthFactor^\VarUseful\VarInitCapacity$. Dividing $\FuncSpaceDynamicArray(n)$ by $\FuncSpaceGrowthArray(n)$, I receive
\begin{align*}
\frac{\FuncSpaceDynamicArray(n)}{\FuncSpaceGrowthArray(n)} &\sim \frac{1}{\VarGrowthFactor^\VarUseful\VarInitCapacity} \cdot \left( \frac{\VarGrowthFactor^{\VarUseful + 1} - 1}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} \right) \VarInitCapacity &&\text{(Theorem \ref{thm:MergesOverOps})}\\
&= \frac{\VarGrowthFactor - 1 / {\VarGrowthFactor^\VarUseful}}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1}\\
&\sim \frac{\VarGrowthFactor}{\VarGrowthFactor - 1} &&\text{(Theorem \ref{thm:RemovesLowerOrderTerms})}
\end{align*}
For $\VarGrowthFactor = 2$, this can be interpreted as ``\underline{For large $n$, dynamic arrays use approximately twice as much space as growth arrays.}''
