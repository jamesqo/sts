The iteration algorithm for growth arrays is not quite as simple. As shown in Section \ref{subsec:Indexing}, growth arrays' random access algorithm can be expensive; thus, it is best avoided. The following algorithm implements iteration without using the random access algorithm.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{``$\TextFor \LclItem \TextIn \VarList$'' algorithm \TextGrowthArray}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\For{$\LclBuffer \TextIn \VarList.\FieldTail$}
			\For{$\LclItem \TextIn \LclBuffer$}
				\State $\TextDoSomethingWith \LclItem$
			\EndFor
		\EndFor
		\For{$\LclIndex = 0,\ \LclIndex < \VarList.\FieldHeadSize,\ \LclIndex \gets \LclIndex + 1$}
			\State $\TextDoSomethingWith \VarList.\FieldHead[\LclIndex]$
		\EndFor
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Since this algorithm loops over $n$ items, its time complexity is $O(n)$. There is nothing to suggest that this algorithm should be substantially slower than dynamic arrays' algorithm. Even though the inner loop is occasionally `interrupted' by having to switch buffers, the number of such interruptions is $O(\log n)$, so their cost is minuscule. Thus, the only substantial work done by this algorithm is iterating the buffers, which is roughly the same as the work done by dynamic arrays' algorithm. Therefore, both algorithms should run in approximately the same time.
