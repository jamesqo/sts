\textbf{Iterating} a collection is the process of performing some action on each of its elements. When the syntax ``$\TextFor item \TextIn collection$'' is used in pseudocode, its iteration algorithm is implicitly being used.

It is very common to iterate a dynamic array once some items are appended to it. In this section, I wish to show that it is not significantly slower to iterate a growth array.
