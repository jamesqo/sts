Informally, to \textbf{iterate} a collection is to loop over each of its elements. The syntax ``$\TextFor \LclItem \TextIn \LclCollection$'' implicitly uses the iteration algorithm of $\LclCollection$.

It is very common to iterate a dynamic array once items are appended to it. In this section, I will show that growth arrays perform comparably to dynamic arrays for iteration.
