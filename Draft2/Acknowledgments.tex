I would like to thank my research mentor Gary Rubinstein, who provided invaluable feedback on my paper and guided me throughout the research process. I am also grateful to Stuyvesant teacher Peter Brooks and Joel Brewster Lewis from George Washington University for reviewing my paper and providing additional insights. Last but not least, a thank you goes to Vladlena Powers from Columbia University for inspiring me to pursue scientific research.
