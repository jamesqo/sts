I would like to thank my research mentor Gary Rubinstein, who provided invaluable feedback on my paper and guided me throughout the research process. I am also grateful to my teacher Joseph Stern, who thoughtfully made time to review the math with me. Additional thanks goes to Peter Brooks and Joel Brewster Lewis for providing additional insights. Last but not least, thank you to Vladlena Powers for inspiring me to pursue scientific research.
