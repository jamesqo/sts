\dynarrayimpl

I will first implement appending for dynamic arrays. Let $\listname$ be a dynamic array. The following definitions are used in the code:

\begin{description}
	\item[initial capacity] The capacity of a dynamic a array when one item is appended to it. I denote this $\initcapacity$.\\
	(The capacity of any dynamic array with size zero should be zero.)
	\item[growth factor] The factor by which the current capacity is multiplied to get the new capacity when $\listname$ is resized. I denote this with $\growthfactor$.
\end{description}

\begin{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\State
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\tcomplex

Before I analyze the time complexity of [append], I consider a different method for measuring its cost. Suppose I start with an empty list and $\varnitems$ elements are appended. How many times is an element stored in an array? I will term the answer to this question the \textbf{write cost} of $\varnitems$ appends, and denote it $\nwritesfn(n)$.

In the above code, one write is performed after the conditional, so it is apparent that $\nwritesfn(\varnitems) \geq \varnitems$ after $n$ appends. However, [resize] also does some writing, so in order to find a precise formula for $\nwritesfn(\varnitems)$, I need to analyze when [resize] is called. Consider the following lemma:

[lemma]
Let $\listname$ by a dynamic array. As $\varnitems$ are appended, the sequence of capacities $\listname$ takes on is $$S_C = 0,\ \initcapacity,\ \growthfactor\initcapacity,\ \growthfactor^2\initcapacity,\ \ldots\ \growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil}\initcapacity$$.

[proof]
The capacity starts out at zero and becomes $\initcapacity$ once one element is appended. From then on, it can only grow by a factor of $\growthfactor$ via [resize], so if $\growthfactor^i\initcapacity$ is the current capacity then $\growthfactor^{i + 1}\initcapacity$ must be the next capacity. By induction, the rest of the sequence is $$\left\{ \growthfactor^i\initcapacity \right\}_{i = 1}^k$$ for some $k$. Since the capacity is only as big as is needs to be, namely greater than or equal to $\varnitems$, $k$ is the smallest integer for which $\growthfactor^k\initcapacity \geq \varnitems$. Using this property, I now derive $k$.

\begin{align*}
\growthfactor^k\initcapacity &\geq \varnitems\\
\growthfactor^k &\geq \frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity}\\
k &\geq \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity\\
k &\geq \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity > k - 1\\
k &= \big\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \big\rceil
\end{align*}

Then the final term in the sequence is $\growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil}\initcapacity$, completing the proof.

[make lemma]
Now, consider that to grow by $\growthfactor$ [resize] must be called. So $\growthfactor^k\initcapacity$ being present in $S_C$ means [resize] was called at size $\growthfactor^{k - 1}\initcapacity$ for $k \geq 1$. Then [resize] was called at the sizes $$S_R = 0,\ \initcapacity,\ \growthfactor\initcapacity,\ \growthfactor^2\initcapacity,\ \ldots\ \growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil - 1}\initcapacity$$

Each time [resize] is called, $i$ items are copied where $i$ is the current size of the dynamic array. Then the total number of items copied for $\varnitems$ appends is

\begin{align*}
0 + \initcapacity + \growthfactor\initcapacity + \ldots + \growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil - 1}\initcapacity &= \left( \frac{\growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity
\end{align*}

Finally, appending the writes made for every item in [append], I finally find an explicit formula for $\nwritesfn(\varnitems)$.

[ref1]
$$
\nwritesfn(\varnitems) = \varnitems + \left( \frac{\growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity
$$

[ref2]
To make this expression easier to work with, I will write it in big-P notation to approximate it for large $\varnitems$. First I note that $\log_{\growthfactor} k \leq \lceil \log_{\growthfactor} k \rceil < \left( \log_{\growthfactor} k \right) + 1$ for any $k > 0$, so $k \leq \growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} k \rceil} < \growthfactor{k}$. Then

\begin{align*}
\nwritesfn(\varnitems) &= \varnitems + \left( \frac{\growthfactor^{\big\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \left( \frac {\varnitems} {\initcapacity} \right) \big\rceil} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity\\
\varnitems + \left( \frac{\frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity \leq \nwritesfn(\varnitems) &< \varnitems + \left( \frac{\growthfactor\frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity\\
\varnitems + \left( \frac{\varnitems - \initcapacity}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \leq \nwritesfn(\varnitems) &< \varnitems + \left( \frac{\growthfactor\varnitems - \initcapacity}{\growthfactor - 1} \right)\\
\biggo\left( \varnitems + \left( \frac{\varnitems - \initcapacity}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \right) \leq \biggo\left( \nwritesfn(\varnitems) \right) &< \biggo\left( \varnitems + \left( \frac{\growthfactor\varnitems - \initcapacity}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \right)\\
\biggo\left( \left( \frac{\growthfactor}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \varnitems \right) \leq \biggo\left( \nwritesfn(\varnitems) \right) &< \biggo\left( \left( \frac{2\growthfactor - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \varnitems \right)
\end{align*}

\scomplex

I wish to find the space allocated while appending $\varnitems$ items to a dynamic array. I denote this quantity $\spacefn(\varnitems)$, and define it as the total length of all arrays allocated during $\varnitems$ [append] calls. I now derive a formula for $\spacefn(\varnitems)$.

From [lemma] I know the exact capacities $\listname$ takes on as $\varnitems$ items are appended. Dynamic arrays also have the property that $i \in S_C$ iff an array of length $i$ was allocated. Then the total length of arrays allocated is

\begin{align*}
\spacefn(\varnitems) &= \sum_{i \in S_C} i\\
&= 0 + \initcapacity + \growthfactor\initcapacity + \growthfactor^2\initcapacity + \ldots + \growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil}\initcapacity\\
&= \left( \frac{\growthfactor^{\lceil \log_{\growthfactor} \varnitems - \log_{\growthfactor} \initcapacity \rceil + 1} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity
\end{align*}

Using the identity in [ref2] again, I bound its big-P complexity:

\begin{align*}
\left( \frac{\growthfactor \frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity \leq \spacefn(\varnitems) &< \left( \frac{\growthfactor^2 \frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity\\
\biggo\left( \left( \frac{\growthfactor \frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity \right) \leq \biggo\left( \spacefn(\varnitems) \right) &< \biggo\left( \left( \frac{\growthfactor^2 \frac{\varnitems}{\initcapacity} - 1}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \initcapacity \right)\\
\biggo\left( \left( \frac{\growthfactor}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \varnitems \right) \leq \biggo\left( \spacefn(\varnitems) \right) &< \biggo\left( \left( \frac{\growthfactor^2}{\growthfactor - 1} \right) \varnitems \right)
\end{align*}
