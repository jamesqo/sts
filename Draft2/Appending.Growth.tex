I start off again by finding the write cost for $n$ items. Lemma \ref{lem:CapacitySeq} still holds, since growth arrays satisfy the properties used by that proof. In particular, although growth arrays use a different growth algorithm than dynamic arrays, the following claim is still true:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:GrowthArraysGrowthFactor}
	The capacity of a growth array grows by the constant factor $\VarGrowthFactor$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	I prove that the $\FuncGrow$ algorithm enforces this using induction. I induct on the number of times $\FuncGrow$ is called, $k$, showing that for all natural numbers $k$, $\FuncGrow$ behaves correctly when called the $k$th time. I will let $c_i$ and $c_f$ denote the initial/final capacities and $h_i$ and $h_f$ denote the initial/final head capacities for the $k$th call, respectively.

	For $k = 1$, $c_i = \VarInitCapacity$. I wish to show that $c_f = \VarGrowthFactor\VarInitCapacity$. This happens if and only if the next buffer has size $\Delta c = (\VarGrowthFactor - 1)\VarInitCapacity$, which the algorithm ensures.
	
	For $k > 1$, by induction $c_i = \text{previous }c_f = \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2}\VarInitCapacity$, and $h_i = \text{previous }h_f = (\VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2} - \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 3})\VarInitCapacity$. I wish to show $c_f = \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 1}\VarInitCapacity$ and $h_f = (\VarGrowthFactor^{k - 1} - \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2})\VarInitCapacity$. Because $k > 1$, the algorithm will calculate $h_f$ as $\VarGrowthFactor$ times $h_i$. Then
	\begin{align*}
	h_f &= \VarGrowthFactor h_i = \VarGrowthFactor (\VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2} - \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 3})\VarInitCapacity = (\VarGrowthFactor^{k - 1} - \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2})\VarInitCapacity
	\end{align*}
	and
	\begin{align*}
	c_f &= c_i + h_f = \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2}\VarInitCapacity + (\VarGrowthFactor^{k - 1} - \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 2})\VarInitCapacity = \VarGrowthFactor^{k - 1}\VarInitCapacity
	\end{align*}
	as desired.
\end{proof}

Since Lemma \ref{lem:GrowthArraysGrowthFactor} has been proven, Lemma \ref{lem:CapacitySeq} and all results based on it must also hold true for growth arrays. Now, I am ready to find the write cost of $\FuncGrow$. Unlike dynamic arrays, $\FuncGrow$ does not make $\VarGrowSeq_i$ writes when the current size is $\VarGrowSeq_i$. In fact, $\FuncGrow$ does not copy \textit{any} items supplied by the user. Writes are only made when a buffer is appended to the tail, since the tail is a dynamic array.

Let $\FuncWritesByGrow(n)$ denote the total number of writes made by $\FuncGrow$, and let $\VarNumItemsTail$ be the size of the tail. Since Corollary \ref{coro:GrowthSeq} also holds true for growth arrays, $\FuncGrow$ is called $|\VarGrowSeq|$ times. A buffer is appended to the tail each time $\FuncGrow$ is called. Thus, the tail's size is
\begin{align*}
\VarNumItemsTail &= |\VarGrowSeq| = |\VarCapacitySeq| - 1 = \VarUseful
\end{align*}
Then the formula for $\FuncWritesByGrow(n)$ is simply $\FuncWritesTail(\VarUseful)$, where $\FuncWritesTail$ denotes the tail's write cost function, that is, the write cost function for dynamic arrays. Finally, adding the writes made by $\FuncAppend$, the formula for $\FuncWrites(n)$ is
\begin{align*}
\FuncWrites(n) = n + \FuncWritesTail(\VarUseful)
\end{align*}
Now, I approximate $\FuncWrites(n)$ using $\sim$. To do this, I will derive the big-O complexity of $\VarUseful$.

\begin{lemma}
	$\VarUseful = O(\log n)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	From \ref{lem:CapacitySeq}, $\VarUseful = \max(\ExprMessy, 0)$. As mentioned in Lemma \ref{lem:ToVarUsefulPowerBounds}, for sufficiently large $n$, $\VarUseful = \ExprMessy$. Then
	\begin{align*}
	\VarUseful \sim \ExprMessy \sim \left( \ExprMessyInner \right) \sim \log_{\VarGrowthFactor} n
	\end{align*}
	By [lemma], $O(\VarUseful) = O(\log_{\VarGrowthFactor} n) = O(\log n)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

I now approximate this expression using $\sim$. First, I approximate $k$ using big-O:

\begin{align*}
k &= \lceil \log_{\VarGrowthFactor} n - \log_{\VarGrowthFactor} \VarInitCapacity \rceil\\
O(k) &= O(\log n)
\end{align*}

Now, the $k$-term disappears when using $\sim$ to approximate $\FuncWrites(n)$, leaving just $n$:

\begin{align*}
\FuncWrites(n) &\sim n + \FuncWrites(k)\\
&= n + O(\log n)\\
&\sim n
\end{align*}

% Should this be C(n) instead of C?
The space function for $n$ $\FuncAppend$ calls on a growth array is denoted $\FuncSpace(n)$. Since growth arrays never throw away item buffers, if the current capacity is $C$ then the total length of item buffers is also $C$. $\FuncSpace(n)$ is usually greater than $C$, however; this is because growth arrays not only allocate item buffers, but stores references to them in the tail. Thus the space the tail allocates must also be determined.

I determined in [...] that if $n$ are appended then the tail is appended to $k$ times, where $k = \lceil \log_{\VarGrowthFactor} n - \log_{\VarGrowthFactor} \VarInitCapacity \rceil$. Since the tail is a dynamic array, it allocates $\FuncSpace(k)$ space, where $\FuncSpace$ is the space function of the tail. Through a similar method to [...] it can be shown $O(\FuncSpace(k)) = O(k) = O(\log n)$. Then % TODO: P-analysis should come after the explicit formula.

\begin{align*}
\FuncSpace(n) \sim 2^{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil} = O(n)
\end{align*}
